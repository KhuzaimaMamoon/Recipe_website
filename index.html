            <ul class="list">
                <li> package (about 36) Oreo cookies</li>
                <li>1 package (8 oz) cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1-2 cups white or dark chocolate chips, melted</li>
                <li>Valentine's Day-themed sprinkles or decorations (optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <h1 class="procedure">Procedure</h1>
            <p class="para">Place the Oreo cookies in a food processor and pulse until you have fine crumbs.
                If you don't have a food processor, you can place the cookies in a sealed plastic bag and
                crush them using a rolling pin.
                In a mixing bowl, combine the Oreo crumbs with softened cream cheese and vanilla extract.
                Mix until well combined and a dough-like consistency is formed.
                Scoop out small portions of the mixture and roll them into 1-inch balls. Place the truffles
                on a parchment-lined tray.
                Place the tray with the truffles in the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes to allow them
                to firm up.
                In a heatproof bowl, melt the white or dark chocolate chips in the microwave or using a
                double boiler.
                Place the coated truffles back on the parchment-lined tray and refrigerate until the
                chocolate coating is set.
                Once the chocolate is firm, your Valentine's Day Oreo Truffles are ready to be served.
                Place them in festive cupcake liners or a decorative box for a lovely presentation.
                Enjoy with your special someone!
